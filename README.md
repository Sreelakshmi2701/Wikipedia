This project will show the list of Wikipedia articles.
I have added 4 main functionalities in this application which are
	*Explore- It displays a list of randomn articles from Wikipedia
	*Search- The search toolbar  will display the articles relevant to the search keyword
	*Favourites-It displays the user's favorite article which they can select while reading the article.
	*History- It contains all the user visited pages
